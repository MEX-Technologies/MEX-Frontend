# Remittances in Emerging Markets

*Published: January 10, 2025*

Remittances play a crucial role in the economies of emerging markets, yet traditional banking systems make these transfers expensive and slow.

## The Remittance Challenge

Every year, billions of dollars flow from developed countries to emerging markets through remittances. However, traditional systems charge high fees and take days to process.
